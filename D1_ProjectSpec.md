### Overview
The project that I am making is a discord-like chatting computer program for desktop and laptop computers that translates parts of your message to a different language.
People will be able to chat in real time with others who connect to the program and see previous messages from other people. The point of this program is to see how people's communication is changed by making the communication more opaque in ways the subject can't control
