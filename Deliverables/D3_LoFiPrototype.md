Reflection: A major issue that I kept running into was learning how to properly insert images into markdown files. Even after having 
been shown an example, the process just didn't seem to work. Whenever I (seemingly) input the correct syntax for the image file to be
displayed, the markdown file itself would just show the link/file directory in plaintext, no matter what I did. It was very frustrating.
The flow charts themselves were a little confusing at first with regards to what exactly was being asked of me, but after some talks
with the professor, I think I was able to better understand what exactly was being asked of me. As for the wireframe prototypes of the
various screens of my app, I made the new screens from the ground up rather than simply copy what I did for D2. Unfortunatley, I'm not
super creative so the results are still fairly similar to those old screenshots. Working with a digital program like Figma seemed more
professional to me than making a paper or cardboard prototype and taking a picture of it to post, which is why I stuck with Figma.
