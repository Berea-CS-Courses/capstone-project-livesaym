Reflection: I know the full D3 isn't due yet, but so far the most difficult part has been trying to properly add files to markdown.
I'm pretty sure I didn't do it correctly here, but none of the tutorials I looked at online were all that useful. I'm also not completley
sure I got the Data flow diagram done correctly. I tried following the example diagram from the google doc, with squares being
stored data and circles representing data being processed, but I'm not sure if I portrayed it 100% correctly. I already had a visualization
of my UI from D2, so making the paper prototype UI shouldn't be too much of an issue for me.
