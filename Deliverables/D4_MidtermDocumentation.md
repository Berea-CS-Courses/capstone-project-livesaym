Proof of Concept

Concept Documentation
The proof-of-concept as it exists requires the installation of the Pycharm program, the most up-to-date version of Python, and the sockets and tkinter libraries. 
In order to run the proof-of-concept, you simply need to open the files in pycharm, run the “main” file, and then run the “client” file. The result is a GUI that
displays messages sent by the client to the server, as well as the username of the client. Unfortunately, the program has an issue with not responding after 
starting. Portions of the socket code in the server were taken from Stack Overflow.

Reflection
Now that I’ve created a working proof of concept, I feel a bit more confident in my ability to complete the project. One of the things that I thought was going
to be one of the larger stumbling blocks was understanding sockets and how to implement them, since I haven't taken a class on them and they seemed very
complicated. Now that I have implemented a working version of python sockets, I feel much more confident. As for what I think I’ll need help with, integrating
different parts of the project, such as user interface and translation. I’ll be sure to ask for help when I think I need it going forward.
